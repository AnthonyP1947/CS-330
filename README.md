1. How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by being with analyzing the project's requirments. I then create smaller tasks i need to implement starting with the base functional tasks first.

2. How do I approach developing programs?

I tend to create a low functional prototype then expand on that in order to get the product i expected or the requirments expects. I started with a very simple object and just continue to expand my code to handle the more demanding tasks.

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer Science helps me reach my goals by providing me with job to provide for myself and eventual family. I recently started working for infosys at the beginning of this term and the skills i've been gaining has help be stay motivated when facing difficult tasks at work. This course has been the most difficult so far even compared to work tasks but i think i've gain new insight on figuring out how to handle stress and the time needed to be successful. I 'm currently work with unity, unreal engine and blender and i think knowing how these software work by abstracting a lot of the logic will help be continue to grow in that aspect.
